```

# Append to exisitng file (add new content to file)
```bash
cat /etc/passwd >> mypasswd.txt
```

# Extract content from file
```bash
cat mypasswd.txt | cut -d ':' -f 1
Behind the scenes, the cat commandâ€™s output was sent to the cut command as an input, and it used -d (delimiter) flag with a colon as a separator/delimiter and -f (field) option to get the 1st field.

-d - delimter flag 
-f - field (to get first field)
```

# Exit Codes
```bash
The exit code returned by a program could be obtained through echo $?
```

# Exit Codes with Security Tools
```bash
In the context of security tooling, unsuccessful execution generally means that the security tool found vulnerabilities.

In many cases, a mature security tool would return an exit code of zero indicating that the tool found no vulnerabilities.
A mature security tool would return a non zero exit code indicating that the tool found one or more security vulnerabilities.
